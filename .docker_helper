# This file is designed to be used when running boot2docker. If you would like to modify for use directly in docker then simply remove the boot2docker related lines.

# This function can be used on a clean install of boot2docker to prepare a network mounted volume. The volume can then be mounted
# into containers which allows developers to live edit source code etc without having to restart the container/rebuild the image.
# THIS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION! - make a dedicated data volume
function lhinit {
	boot2docker up && boot2docker ssh
	# Create a new data volume with the name 'lh-projects' and a mount point of '/src'
	docker run -v /src --restart=always --name lh-projects busybox true
	# Start a samba server for the above data volume.
	docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin/docker:/docker -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock svendowideit/samba lh-projects
	# Once this has completed you are able to mount the data volume by passing '--volumes-from lh-projects' as a flag to 'docker run'
}

# This is a really contrived example of how to setup a boot shortcut for a given project. Runs the GAE dev server and shows the console output.
